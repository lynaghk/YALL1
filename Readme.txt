First run "Run_me_1st" from this directory. Then, you can try
any of the demo files, but in order to run the 3rd-party codes
SPGl1 and l1_ls (provided you already installed them), you will
need to edit relevant demo files.

In order to run demo_hard.m, you need to download from the
YALL1 site the 2 data files: hard150.mat and hard8nz.mat, and
put them in the same folder or the search path.

In order to use the discrete Walsh-Hadamard transform, the script
Run_Me_1st.m will try to "mex" the file fastWHtrans.cpp in the
Utilities directory, which will require a relevant compiler
installed on your system.
